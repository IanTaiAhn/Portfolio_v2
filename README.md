# Portfolio_v2

I'm creating a new portfolio because my first one was stinky. I'm liking it a lot more already! I want to make this a very modern looking website,
and something that I'll be able to advertise for other people than myself.
I think eventually I want to purchase a domain, and try github pages option of hosting the website at a custom domain.
